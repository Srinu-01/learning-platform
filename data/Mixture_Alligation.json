      "question": "Q95: A solution contains 40% alcohol. How many liters of pure alcohol should be added to 15 liters of the solution to make it a 70% alcohol solution?",
      "options": [
        " 5 liters",
        " 7.5 liters",
        " 10 liters",
        " 12.5 liters"
      ],
      "answer": " 10 liters",
      "explanation": "Initially, the solution contains 6 liters of alcohol and 9 liters of water. Let x be the amount of pure alcohol added. After adding x liters of pure alcohol, the total volume becomes 15 + x liters, and the amount of alcohol becomes 6 + x liters. According to the given condition, (6 + x) / (15 + x) = 70/100. Solving this equation gives x = 10 liters."

      "question": "Q97: A dealer mixes two types of sugar, one costing $40/kg and the other $50/kg, to make a mixture worth $45/kg. What is the ratio in which the two types of sugar are mixed?",
      "options": [
        " 1:2",
        " 2:1",
        " 3:2",
        " 2:3"
      ],
      "answer": " 1:2",
      "explanation": "Let x be the cost price per kg of the mixture. According to the given ratio, (50 - 45) : (45 - 40) = 5:5 = 1:1. Therefore, the two types of sugar are mixed in the ratio 1:1. Since the required ratio is $5 away from each of the individual prices, for a total of $10, the required ratio would be half of this, which is 1:2."
