      "question": "A solution contains 20% alcohol. How many liters of pure alcohol should be added to 10 liters of the solution to make it a 50% alcohol solution?",
      "options": [
        " 5 liters",
        " 7.5 liters",
        " 10 liters",
        " 12.5 liters"
      ],
      "answer": " 12.5 liters",
      "explanation": "Initially, the solution contains 2 liters of alcohol and 8 liters of water. Let x be the amount of pure alcohol added. After adding x liters of pure alcohol, the total volume becomes 10 + x liters, and the amount of alcohol becomes 2 + x liters. According to the given condition, (2 + x) / (10 + x) = 50/100. Solving this equation gives x = 12.5 liters."

      "question": "A 30-liter mixture of milk and water contains milk and water in the ratio 3:1. How much of the mixture must be replaced with water so that the resulting mixture has equal parts of milk and water?",
      "options": [
        " 5 liters",
        " 10 liters",
        " 15 liters",
        " 20 liters"
      ],
      "answer": " 15 liters",
      "explanation": "Initially, the mixture contains 22.5 liters of milk and 7.5 liters of water. Let's assume x liters of the mixture is replaced with water. After replacement, the amount of milk remains 22.5 liters, and the total mixture remains 30 liters. According to alligation, the ratio of milk to water should be 1 : 1. So, 22.5 / (7.5 + x) = 1 / 1. Solving this equation gives x = 15 liters."

      "question": "A 60-liter mixture of milk and water contains milk and water in the ratio 3:2. How much of the mixture must be replaced with milk so that the resulting mixture has milk and water in the ratio 4:3?",
      "options": [
        " 10 liters",
        " 15 liters",
        " 20 liters",
        " 25 liters"
      ],
      "answer": " 15 liters",
      "explanation": "Initially, the mixture contains 36 liters of milk and 24 liters of water. Let's assume x liters of the mixture is replaced with milk. After replacement, the total mixture remains 60 liters. According to alligation, the ratio of milk to water should be 4 : 3. So, (36 + x) / (24 - x) = 4 / 3. Solving this equation gives x = 15 liters."
