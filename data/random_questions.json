      "question": "How many different permutations can be made using the letters of the word 'SUCCESS'?",
      "options": [
        "2520",
        "720",
        "5040",
        "362880"
      ],
      "answer": "2520",
      "explanation": "The word 'SUCCESS' has 7 letters with repetitions: 3 'S' and 2 'C'. The total number of permutations is 7! / (3! * 2!) = 2,520."

      "question": "A solution contains 20% alcohol. How many liters of pure alcohol should be added to 20 liters of the solution to make it a 40% alcohol solution?",
      "options": [
        " 5 liters",
        " 7.5 liters",
        " 10 liters",
        " 12.5 liters"
      ],
      "answer": " 10 liters",
      "explanation": "Initially, the solution contains 4 liters of alcohol and 16 liters of water. Let x be the amount of pure alcohol added. After adding x liters of pure alcohol, the total volume becomes 20 + x liters, and the amount of alcohol becomes 4 + x liters. According to the given condition, (4 + x) / (20 + x) = 40/100. Solving this equation gives x = 10 liters."

        " 10 liters",
        " 15 liters",
        " 20 liters"
      ],
      "answer": " 20 liters",
      "explanation": "Initially, the solution contains 3 liters of acid and 7 liters of water. Let x be the amount of pure acid added. After adding x liters of pure acid, the total volume becomes 10 + x liters, and the amount of acid becomes 3 + x liters. According to the given condition, (3 + x) / (10 + x) = 60/100. Solving this equation gives x = 20 liters."
